# ChurnModellingAnalysis

Churn calculations are based on how many customers left the service during a given time period. Churn Modelling shows how churn is impacting the business.

In this project, analysis is done using Artificial Neural Networks. It is trained on the dataset of bank customers and efficiency is calculated using Confusion Matrix. It can also be used to predict whether the customer can leave the bank or not in the future.
